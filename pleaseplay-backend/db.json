      "review": "This game was amazing on all accounts of the word. I have never played a game that has connected me so well and emotionally to the video game characters. You go on a cross country dangerous adventure with a grown man watching over a small teenager. A meaningless trip soon becomes one of the the most meaningfull trips in the history of the world, as you head out to get the young girl to safety (for certain reasons I will not spoil). I ask that you PLEASE PLAY The Last of Us because I can confidently say that there is no other game out there that even comes close to making you feel, experience and go through what you do with this game. One of the most carefully crafted games I have ever encountered."
